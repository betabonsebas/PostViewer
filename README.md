# PostViewer

PostViewer Is an App Builded with JSONPlaceholder rest API by Typicode.

It contains the logic to get the posts and its comments.

was builded on MVC Pattern.
I tried to apply some concepts like coordinators and repositories.
all the code incluiding Pods are in the repo, and builded on Xcode 10.1.

I used the Plist approach to persist the info.
